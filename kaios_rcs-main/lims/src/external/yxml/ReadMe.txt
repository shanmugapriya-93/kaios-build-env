Yxml is a small (6 KiB) non-validating yet mostly conforming XML parser written in C. 
Its primary goals are small binary size, simplicity and correctness. It also happens
to be pretty fast.

The code can be obtained from the git repo (git://g.blicky.net/yxml.git) and is available under a permissive MIT license.
The only two files you need are yxml.c and yxml.h, which can easily be included and compiled
as part of your project.
